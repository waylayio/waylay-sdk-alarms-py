# Waylay Alarms Service
No description provided (generated by Openapi Generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator)

This Python package is automatically generated based on the 
Waylay Alarms OpenAPI specification (API version: 1.11.0)
For more information, please visit [the openapi specification](https://docs.waylay.io/openapi/public/redocly/alarms.html).

It is considered an extension of the waylay-sdk-alarms package, and it consists of the typed model classes for all path params, query params, body params and responses for each of the api methods in `waylay-sdk-alarms`.

## Requirements.
This package requires Python 3.9+.

## Installation

Normally this package is installed together with support for other services using the [waylay-sdk](https://pypi.org/project/waylay-sdk/) umbrella package:
* `pip install waylay-sdk` will install `waylay-sdk-alarms` together with the SDK api packages for other services.
* `pip install waylay-sdk[types-alarms]` will additionally install the types package `waylay-sdk-alarms-types`.
* `pip install waylay-sdk[types]` will install the types packages for this and all other services.

Alternatively, you can install support for this _alarms_ service only, installing or extending an existing [waylay-sdk-core](https://pypi.org/project/waylay-sdk-core/):

- `pip install waylay-sdk-alarms` to only install api support for _alarms_.
- `pip install waylay-sdk-alarms[types]` to additionally install type support for _alarms_.

## Usage

```python
from pprint import pprint

# Import the waylay-client from the waylay-sdk-core package
from waylay.sdk.client import WaylayClient
from waylay.sdk.api.api_exceptions import ApiError

# Intialize a waylay client instance
waylay_client = WaylayClient.from_profile()

# Note that the typed model classes for responses/parameters/... are only available when `waylay-sdk-alarms-types` is installed
from waylay.services.alarms.models.version_response import VersionResponse
try:
    # Get Service Information
    # calls `GET /alarms/v1`
    api_response = await waylay_client.alarms.about.get(
    )
    print("The response of alarms.about.get:\n")
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiError as e:
    print("Exception when calling alarms.about.get: %s\n" % e)
```
