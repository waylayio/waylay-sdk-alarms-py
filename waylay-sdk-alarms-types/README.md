# Waylay Alarms Service
No description provided (generated by Openapi Generator https://github.com/openapitools/openapi-generator)

This Python package is automatically generated based on the 
Waylay Alarms OpenAPI specification (API version: 1.11.0)

It is considered an extension of the waylay-sdk-alarms package, and it consists of the typed model classes for all path params, query params, body params and responses for each of the api methods in `waylay-sdk-alarms`.

## Requirements.
This package requires Python 3.9+.

## Installation
Typically this package is installed when installing the [waylay-sdk](https://github.com/waylayio/waylay-sdk-py) package to enable the service's functionality.
When the service api methods are required, waylay-sdk-alarms is included in:
- ```pip install waylay-sdk[alarms]``` to install `waylay-sdk` along with only this service, or
- ```pip install waylay-sdk[services]``` to install `waylay-sdk` along with all services.
When the typed models are required, both waylay-sdk-alarms and waylay-sdk-alarms-types are included in:
- ```pip install waylay-sdk[alarms,alarms-types]``` to install `waylay-sdk` along with only this service including the typed models, or
- ```pip install waylay-sdk[services,services-types]``` to install `waylay-sdk` along with all services along with the typed models.

## Usage


```python
from pprint import pprint

# Import the waylay-client from the waylay-sdk package
from waylay.sdk.client import WaylayClient
from waylay.sdk.api.api_exceptions import ApiError

# Intialize a waylay client instance
waylay_client = WaylayClient.from_profile()

# Note that the typed model classes for responses/parameters/... are only available when `waylay-sdk-alarms-types` is installed
from ..models.get_eventstream_event_format_parameter import GetEventstreamEventFormatParameter
from ..models.nd_json_response_stream import NdJsonResponseStream
try:
    # Alarm Events
    # calls `GET /alarms/v1/events`
    api_response = await waylay_client.alarms.alarm_events.get(
        # query parameters:
        query = {
            'eventFormat': 'application/cloudevents+json'
        },
    )
    print("The response of alarms.alarm_events.get:\n")
    pprint(api_response)
except ApiError as e:
    print("Exception when calling alarms.alarm_events.get: %s\n" % e)
```
